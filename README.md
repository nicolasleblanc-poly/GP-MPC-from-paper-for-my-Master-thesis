The given code is from the IV-DQN repository: https://github.com/SimonRennotte/Data-Efficient-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Probabilistic-Model-Predictive-Control

The original code was made for the Pendulum and the continuous Mountain Car environments. I adapted the code and added config files for the continuous Lunar Lander, continuous Cart Pole, Pendulum, Inverted Pendulum, MuJoCo Reacher, and Panda Gym Reach (dense and sparse rewards) environments.
